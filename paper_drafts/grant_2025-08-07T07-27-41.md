# Research Paper Review
## Summary

The paper proposes a research concept to create standardized psychometric benchmarks using public datasets, focusing on the Chilean Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey (ELPI). The project aims to integrate ELPI data into the Item Response Warehouse (IRW), develop benchmarks for early childhood development measures, and test new psychometric methods. The expected impact includes providing high-quality data for researchers, supporting methodological innovation, and informing policy-making.
