# Psychometric Benchmark Research Concept

## Core Idea
Create standardized psychometric benchmarks using high-quality public datasets from the Item Response Warehouse (IRW) backlog, starting with Chilean Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey (ELPI) data.

## Why This Matters
Psychometrics lacks sufficient public data compared to other fields. The IRW aims to fix this by collecting and standardizing item response datasets, but needs more diverse, high-quality data sources.

## Primary Dataset: Chilean ELPI
**What it is**: Longitudinal survey of 15,175 Chilean children (ages 6 months to 5 years) tracked from 2010-2017

**Why it's valuable**:
- Contains validated psychometric instruments (TEPSI, TVIP, WAIS)
- Measures cognitive, language, and socio-emotional development
- Includes rich contextual data (socioeconomic status, home environment)
- Multiple waves enabling developmental trajectory analysis

## Research Goals

### 1. Data Integration
- Convert ELPI data to IRW standard format
- Ensure proper harmonization with existing IRW datasets
- Create comprehensive documentation

### 2. Benchmark Development
- Establish norms for early childhood development measures
- Create reference standards for Item Response Theory models
- Develop cross-cultural comparison baselines

### 3. Methodological Innovation
- Test new psychometric methods on standardized data
- Enable rapid validation of measurement approaches
- Support reproducible research practices

## Research Questions
1. How can ELPI data enhance existing psychometric benchmarks?
2. What developmental patterns emerge when using standardized IRW formatting?
3. How do Chilean early childhood measures compare to other international datasets?
4. What new methodological insights emerge from this large-scale data?

## Expected Impact
- **For Researchers**: Access to high-quality, standardized developmental data
- **For Methods**: Robust testing ground for new psychometric techniques  
- **For Policy**: Evidence-based tools for evaluating early childhood programs
- **For IRW**: Significantly expanded dataset diversity and quality

## Implementation Steps
1. **Phase 1**: Format ELPI data to IRW standards, create GitHub issue
2. **Phase 2**: Develop initial benchmarks and validation studies
3. **Phase 3**: Expand to other backlog datasets, publish methodology papers

## Next Actions
- Contact IRW maintainers about ELPI integration
- Begin data formatting following IRW standards
- Establish collaboration with Chilean ELPI data holders
- Submit proposal to relevant funding agencies

This project transforms valuable longitudinal data into a powerful resource for advancing psychometric science.
